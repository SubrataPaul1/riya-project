        <h2>Favourite Animal: Dog</h2>
        <p>
          My favorite animal is the dog because of its gentle and loyal nature.
          Dogs are known for their strong bond with humans and deep sense of
          trust. They are intelligent, trainable, and always eager to connect.
          Spending time with a dog brings a sense of peace and joy. Their
          playful energy brightens even the dullest days. Dogs are protective,
          often sensing danger before we do. They offer comfort and reduce
          stress without needing to speak a word. Each dog has a unique
          personality, yet all show pure affection. Caring for a dog teaches
          patience, empathy, love, and responsibility. To me, a dog is not just
          an animal, but a true and constant friend.

        <h2>Favourite Flower: Arabian Jasmine</h2>
        <p>
          Arabian Jasmine is my favorite flower because it brings a sense of
          calm and comfort. Its soft white petals reflect purity and quiet
          beauty that feels almost timeless. The gentle fragrance of Arabian
          jasmine creates a peaceful atmosphere wherever it blooms. It often
          blossoms in the evening adding a subtle charm to the night air.
          Arabian jasmine is deeply rooted in many cultures, valued for its
          simplicity and meaning. The flower is often linked to love, purity,
          and spiritual connection. Its presence in gardens and homes brings a
          feeling of warmth and harmony. I admire how something so small can
          hold such deep emotion and grace. The scent of jasmine always reminds
          me of peaceful moments and cherished memories. To me, Arabian jasmine
          represents beauty in simplicity and the quiet strength of nature.

        <h2>Favourite Festival: Durga Puja</h2>
        <p>
          Durga Puja is my favorite festival because it is full of excitement
          and devotion. The whole place is decorated with lights, flowers, and
          beautiful pandals. People wear new clothes and go out with family and
          friends to see the idols. The goddess Durga looks powerful and
          graceful in every pandal. The sound of dhak and the smell of incense
          make the atmosphere magical. Everyone enjoys traditional food and
          sweets during the festival. Many cultural programs, dances, and songs
          happen every evening. It feels good to see people happy and united
          during this time. Durga Puja brings joy, peace, and a strong sense of
          togetherness.

        <h2>Favourite Season: Monsoon</h2>
        <p>
          Monsoon is my favourite season because it brings a refreshing change
          to the weather. The cool breeze and steady rainfall create a peaceful
          atmosphere. The earth smells fresh, and the trees look greener and
          more vibrant. I love watching the rain fall softly on rooftops and
          leaves. The sky stays covered in soft grey clouds, making everything
          feel calm. It’s the best time to enjoy hot snacks and a cup of tea.
          Puddles form everywhere, and children splash in them with joy. The air
          feels clean and light after every shower. Farmers depend on the
          monsoon to grow their crops. This season brings a sense of renewal and
          quiet happiness.

        <h2>Favourite Book: Parineeta</h2>
        <p>
          Parineeta by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay is a beautifully written
          story about love, sacrifice, and societal expectations. It tells the
          tale of Lalita, a gentle and mature girl, and Shekhar, her wealthy and
          conflicted childhood companion. Their deep bond is tested by
          misunderstandings, pride, and class differences. The novel shows how
          silent emotions can be stronger than spoken words. Lalita’s quiet
          strength and dignity leave a lasting impression. Shekhar’s struggle
          between love and ego adds emotional depth. The setting reflects the
          conservative Bengali society of that time. Chattopadhyay’s simple yet
          powerful storytelling brings each character to life. The story moves
          gently but leaves a strong impact. Parineeta is a timeless expression
          of love restrained by tradition.
